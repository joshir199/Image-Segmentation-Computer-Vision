Image Segmentation using U-Net Prebuilt models 



# A U-Net model consists of an encoder (downsampler) and decoder (upsampler). In-order to learn robust features, and reduce the number of trainable parameters, a pretrained model can be used as the encoder.

The task of image segmentation is to train a neural network to output a pixel-wise mask of the image. This helps in understanding the image at a much lower level, i.e., the pixel level.
